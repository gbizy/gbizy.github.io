                My name is Guy and am a cybersecurity professional with strong
                industry foundational knowledge and experience in governance,
                risk & compliance.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Iâ€™ve worked with several security frameworks and standards (NIST
                CSF, ISO 27001, HIPAA) and have directly assisted in developing
                security program strategies for executives.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the technical side of things, I bring a proactive approach to
                cybersecurity with a blend of skills associated with IAM as well
                as securing Web Application and Active Directory environments. I
                have a strong background in programming, IT and networking
                through my B.S. in Computer Science from Binghamton University.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am extremely passionate about cybersecurity awareness. I
                create videos and post writeups for the general public educating
                them on current cyber risks; phishing, online scams, recent data
                breaches and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                To that end, I am a Content Creator. I retain nearly 10 years of
                experience in making engaging narratives, and building social
                accounts from ground zero to 100,000+ followers and getting
                millions of unique views per month, with some accounts totaling
                at over 200 million lifetime impressions. Skilled in crafting
                unique campaigns where tech and humor become one.
